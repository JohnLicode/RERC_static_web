               <h2>About the Committee</h2>
                 <p>Research is one of the four-fold functions of the University. As an institution of higher learning involved in research works, it is paramount to ensure that research participants’ rights and welfare are protected per national and international standards.<br><br>
                  On December 17, 2018, by virtue of Special-Order No. 308, issued by the Office of the University President, Dr. Ramon M. Docto, the Palawan State University Research Ethics Review Committee (PSU RERC) was created. The committee was initially composed of nine members, including the appointed chair. Members are from different fields of specialization.<br><br>
                    On January 30, 2019, the first-ever regular committee meeting was held. With the creation of the University Research Ethics Committee, it is expected that personnel and students alike will make ethics an integral part of research inside and outside of the university, especially those involving human participation.</p>
